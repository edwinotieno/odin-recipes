    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Making homemade donuts can sound like a lot of work, but it’s so worth the bragging rights. The dough itself requires few ingredients and just a little bit of rising and rest time.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ¼ cups milk</li>
        <li>2 ¼ teaspoons (one package) active dry yeast.</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>8 tablespoons (1 stick) butter, melted and cooled.</li>
        <li>¼ cup granulated sugar.</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>4 ¼ cups all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling out the dough</li>
        <li>2 quarts neutral oil, for frying, plus more for the bowl</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the milk until it is warm but not hot, about 90 degrees. In a large bowl, combine it with the yeast. Stir lightly, and let sit until the mixture is foamy, about 5 minutes.
